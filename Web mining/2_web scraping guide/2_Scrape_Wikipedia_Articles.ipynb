       "'renting also known as hiring or letting is an agreement where a payment is made for the temporary use of a good service or property owned by another a gross lease is when the tenant pays a flat rental amount and the landlord pays for all property charges regularly incurred by the ownership an example of renting is equipment rental renting can be an example of the sharing economy  there are many possible reasons for renting instead of buying for example  shortterm rental of all sorts of products excluding real estate and holiday apartments already represents an estimated  billion  billion annual market in europe and is expected to grow further as the internet makes it easier to find specific items available for rent  according to a poll by yougov  of people looking to rent would go to the internet first to find what they need rising to  for those aged     it has been widely reported that the financial crisis of  may have contributed to the rapid growth of online rental marketplaces such as erento as consumers are more likely to consider renting instead of buying in times of financial hardship  environmental concerns fast depreciation of goods and a more transient workforce also mean that consumers are increasingly searching for rentals online   a us survey found  of renters plan to never buy a home   net income received or losses suffered by an investor from renting of one or two properties is subject to idiosyncratic risk due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants   there is typically an implied explicit or written rental agreement or contract involved to specify the terms of the rental which are regulated and managed under contract law  examples include letting out real estate real property for the purpose of housing tenure where the tenant rents a residence to live in parking space for a vehicles storage space whole or portions of properties for business agricultural institutional or government use or other reasons  when renting real estate the persons or party who lives in or occupies the real estate is often called a tenant paying rent to the owner of the property often called a landlord or landlady the real estate rented may be all or part of almost any real estate such as an apartment house building business offices or suite land farm or merely an inside or outside space to park a vehicle or store things all under real estate law  the tenancy agreement for real estate is often called a lease and usually involves specific property rights in real property as opposed to chattels  in india the rental income on property is taxed under the head income from house property a deduction of  is allowed from total rent which is charged to tax  the time use of a chattel or other so called personal property is covered under general contract law but the term lease also nowadays extends to long term rental contracts of more expensive nonreal properties such as automobiles boats planes office equipment and so forth the distinction in that case is long term versus short term rentals some nonreal properties commonly available for rent or lease are   in various degrees renting can involve buying services for various amounts of time such as staying in a hotel using a computer in an internet cafe or riding in a taxicab some forms of english use the term hiring for this activity  as seen from the examples some rented goods are used on the spot but usually they are taken along to help guarantee that they are brought back one or more of the following applies  if the customer has a credit account with the rental company they may rent over several months or years and will receive a recurring or continuation invoice each rental period until they return the equipment in this case deposits are rarely required  in certain types of rental sometimes known as operated or wet rental the charge may be calculated by the rental charge  timesheets of operators or drivers supplied by the rental company to operate the equipment this is particularly relevant for crane rental companies  sometimes the risk that the good is kept is reduced by it being a special model or having signs on it that cannot easily be removed making it obvious that it is owned by the rental company this is especially effective for goods used in public places but even when used at home it may help due to social control  persons and businesses that regularly rent goods from a particular company generally have an account with that company which reduces the administrative procedure transaction costs on each occasion  signing out books from a library could be considered renting when there is a fee per book however the term lending is more common  rental of personal property or real property for periods longer than a year which is governed by the signing of a lease is known as leasing leasing is usually used for highvalue capital equipment both in business and by consumers a lease in which the renter benefits from an increase in value of the asset is known as a finance lease a leasing agreement which is not a finance lease is known as an operating lease  a rental agreement may provide for the renter or lessee to become the owner of the asset at the end of the rental period usually at the renters option on payment of a nominal fee such arrangements may be known
